# PotatOS
A Linux based operating system. Done as a class project. Probably the most difficult piece of software I've written, with help from calculuswhiz and two others.


This was done as a class project for the operating system course at UIUC. Since I'm not paying for github, I don't have access to private repos so I've decided to just make this repo public so I have access to this code. I've changed all commit references to the course to help (a little) with making this harder to find. I do feel a bit guilty since I used to TA the course.
